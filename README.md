# Web Scraping

> ⚠️ **WEB SCRAPING ETIQUETTE**⚠️
> 
> Always play nice with the websites you're scraping; check out their rules and get the green light if needed. Steer clear of swiping personal stuff and be copyright-conscious. Oh, and stay in the know about the legal side of scraping – we don't want any surprise legal drama, right?
> 
> **ALWAYS CHECK THE __robots.txt__ file of the website you are scraping, this will show you which pages you can and cannot crawl.**

## This project includes:
Simple web scraping of a page from the [Vegan Society News](https://www.vegansociety.com/news/news). I first  retrived the news cards on the page, saving them into a CSV file. Next I proceeded by scraping the images on the news, and saving them to my machine.
